JPhantom
========

A tool for Java program complementation. It takes a single jar as its
main argument and complements it by creating a new jar that adds dummy
implementations for every phantom class detected in the original
one. (A *phantom class* is a class that is referenced somewhere but
its definition is missing.)

The phantom classes in the produced jar will contain every missing
field and method that was referenced and used in the original jar, as
well as a supertype that respects every type constraint that was found
(e.g., if phantom class B was used in a place where known class A was
expected, and a [widening reference
conversion](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se14/html/jls-5.html#jls-5.1.5)
took place, then we must conclude that class A is a supertype of B).

You can read more about the underlying problem of class hierarchy
complementation in the [OOPSLA '13 paper](http://yanniss.github.io/jphantom-oopsla13.pdf)
(or the [presentation slides](http://gbalats.github.io/assets/presentations/oopsla2013-jphantom.pdf)).


Release
-------

To list JPhantom as a dependency using Maven, add the following to
your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.clyze</groupId>
  <artifactId>jphantom</artifactId>
  <version>1.4.2</version>
</dependency>
```

To add a dependency using Gradle:

```
dependencies {
  compile 'org.clyze:jphantom:1.4.2'
}
```


Usage
-----

    java -jar <jphantom>  <injar> [--debug] [--help] [--save-class-files] [--soft-fail] [-d <dir>] [-java-version <ver>][-o <outjar>] [-v (--log, --verbose) N]
    
     <injar>                 : the jar to be complemented
     --debug                 : Debug mode
     --help                  : Help
     --save-class-files      : Save phantom class files
     --soft-fail             : Attempt to recover partial results from conflicts
     -d <dir>                : Phantom-classes destination directory
     -java-version <ver>     : Java version to target, defaulting to 5
     -o <outjar>             : the destination path of the complemented jar
     -v (--log, --verbose) N : Level of verbosity


You can use the `--save-class-files` option to save the generated
class files for the phantom classes that were detected in the
process. This is handy when you want to inspect only the code that was
autogenerated, without having to extract the relevant class files from
the complemented jar.

You can also increase the level of verbosity to log every constraint
that was detected by using the `--verbose N` option.
